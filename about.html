              <p class="text-left">In 2019, the ChainLynx team was formed with the goal of encouraging students' development of STEM and leadership skills. This is done through participating in a worldwide robotics competition hosted by the organization FIRST® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). 
				</p>
				<p class="text-left">To do so requires using computer aided design, coding, fundraising and outreach, as well as actually building the robot. This is a large task that requires months of work, but rewards members with experience in STEM, confidence, and access to a wonderful community.</p>

                <h1 class="text-center" id="2019-2020">2019 - 2020</h1>
                <p class="text-left">Our founding year, we created the basics of our club structure. Full of students new to robotics, we were passionate about learning the basics. During this year we created the basis of our club structure, our first robot, and competed in our first competition. </p>
              <p class="text-left">Our team’s first ever robot was the ‘AT-AT’ (a table - a table). This robot heavily incorporates the use of wood in its design. While uncommon, this allowed us to utilize resources we already had access to so we could focus our attention on more pressing matters such as learning how to code and use power tools. We also had generous support of materials and teaching from Viking Robotics and the Iron Riders. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h1 class="text-center" id="2020-2021">2020-2021</h1>
                <p class="text-left">In the face of an unprecedented virus - Covid-19 - our school went fully online, and our club with it. Unable to work on a robot, we dedicated this year to outreach, branding, and online competitions held by FIRST® (see: <a href="#game_design">Game Design, Innovation challenge</a>).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 class="text-left" id="game_design">Game Design:</h2>
                <p class="text-left">In 2021, FIRST® decided that with the possibility of normal robotics competitions becoming superspreader events, it would be safer to hold online ones instead. As the normal competition structure was not possible online, they had to devise new ways for teams to demonstrate their technical expertise. One of the things they came up with was the Game Design challenge. This challenge required our team to create the rules for a possible robotics game - the type that had been held in years prior (an example from 2016’s game can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/VqOKzoHJDjA">here</a>).</p>
                <p class="text-left">In our team’s concept, called Back to School, robots had to pick up ‘keys’, exchange them with human players for ‘books’ and then decide between two scoring options. The first, called the ‘backpack’, was a large box that required pulling on a large zipper to open. This was the higher scoring option, worth four match points. The second option was a large desk that robots could stack the ‘books’ on top of. This netted two match points per book, but robots would gain a special ranking point if they managed to stack five ‘books’ on top of it. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                 <p class="text-left">Ranking points have been a concept in FRC for a while now - and they are what actually determines which team wins the game. One or two is usually given out for having the highest match score, another if a team manages to get a certain number of robots to lift themselves off the ground, and the last is usually reserved for some sort of special task (ex: spinning a wheel to land on a certain color).</p>
                <p class="text-left">Our team’s full submission can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NvAhUWoaVi4VcxMqkz1Fm6fDHMhd3az_CJe_gDmSSo0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

                <h1 class="text-center" id="club_structure">Club Structure</h1>
                <p class="text-left">Our club is divided into two groups: Officers and Leads. The Officers are in charge of how the team operates and functions. The Leads on the other hand, manage the different sub teams (specialized divisions of the team) within ChainLynx and do more work with the actual robot itself. A person can hold both an Officer and Lead position with a few exceptions. A person may also be a part of multiple sub teams. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 class="text-left">Sub Teams:</h2>
                <p>There are sub-team leads for all teams except the drive team.</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Mechanical team:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">This team sketches, prototypes, and CADs to develop a design for the robot based on our strategy for the season. Once a final CAD design is made, they use it as a guide for building the robot.</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Code team:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">As in the name, the code team creates the code for the robot. Our school offers a variety of computer and coding classes so this team can vary quite a bit in skill level. We currently use Java and our github (where we store our code) can be found at: <a href = "https://github.com/ChainLynxRobotics">ChainLynxRobotics · GitHub</a>.</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Business team:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">Running a robotics team takes a surprising amount of money with participation 5,000 necessary a year just to participate in competitions! As such, our business team must hold fundraisers and apply for a variety of grants and sponsorships. This team also often engages in advertising.</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Drive team:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">This team is at the frontline at competitions - driving the robo! While this sounds like a job that could be accomplished by one person, matches are short and often complicated - requiring one person to survey the field and make real time strategy decisions, another to actually drive the robot, and one to two more members to perform maintenance and game specific actions (giving a game piece to the robot - ect).</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Strategy team:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">This team works with the Drive team to figure out what their actions should be for the upcoming matches by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents and teammates.</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Scouting team:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">Similar to the strategy team, the scouting team also analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of other teams; however, this is for the purpose of deciding which teams we wish to ally with.</p>
                
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 class="text-left">Officers:</h2>
                <p>Anyone who holds the President or Vice President position cannot hold any others - lead or officer.</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">President:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">This person works with the team to conduct meetings and acts as the main line of communication between the team and head mentor. In addition to this, they help coordinate the election process (but don’t count/interact with the votes) and represent the club.</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Vice President:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">This officer assists the President in their duties and will take on their duties if the President cannot perform them for any reason.</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Assistant officer:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">The person in this role fills other roles in case of an absence or unoccupied position.</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Safety Officer:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">The Safety officer makes sure that proper procedure is followed when working in the Fabrication lab (when we’re actually building the robot).</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Archivist:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">With team meetings often having a week in between each one, the details of the last one can often be forgotten. To prevent this from becoming a problem, the archivist takes notes on decisions made during a meeting as well as attendance.</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Treasurer:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">While both the Treasurer and the Business lead deal with the club’s finances, the treasurer focuses more on the recording of outgoing and incoming money, and makes sure that all proper school documents concerning this are submitted.</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Event Coordinator:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">This officer alerts the team to any meetings in the coming day(s) through slack and coordinates club meetings and get-togethers.</p>
                <h4 class="text-left">Communications Officer:</h4>
                <p class="text-left">The Communications Officer represents the team, and puts out information on social media platforms and other forms of communication.</p>
